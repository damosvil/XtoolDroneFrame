# XtoolDroneFrame
This is a 58 grams 5 inch Floss Light frame to be used with EMAX 1606 4000kv motors, GF5125 or EMAX AVAN scimitar 5x2.6x3 props, 1100mah batteries and 20x20mm stacks. All meassures are in millimeters.

The arms of this frame are compatible with FLOSS-210 frame. They have the same botom plate M3 hole sizes. So you can print only the arms if you want to try the motors setup.

The recommended esc configuration for these motors in Blheli_M is 48Khz pwm setting. Otherwise they overheat.

Top plate is 3mm thick, middle plate is 2mm thick, bottom plate is 3mm thick, arms and reinforcements are 4mm thick.

This setup is 190 grams dry weight (no battery) and about 340 grams with 1100mah 4s battery.

The motors max pull are 1040 grams each, so for this setup the max pull is 12 times the weight.
